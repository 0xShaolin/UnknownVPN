# UnknownVPN Penetration Test
This test was conducted between 1/2/21 and 1/6/21.
## Scope
The scope of this test was *.unknownvpn.net, unknownvpn.net, any associated services and the Client application.
## Disclaimer
Most, if not all of the vulnerabilities have been patched. Usage of anything within this repository to attack UnknownVPN or any UnknownVPN related services is illegal and is not the responsibility of me or any other member of L33TSTR33T. This writeup is disclosed with express permission and no malicious interaction with the user base occured.
## Ending Notes
There will be a lack of demonstrations and Proof of Concept exploits due to the site getting removed and replaced with a purely html clone. This was done due to some behind the scenes conflict and we will be unable to produce the PoC scripts at the time being. However, every vulnerability will be thoroughly explained and can be verified.
